        <h3>Privacy Overview</h3>

    <p>
      Bullet Planner is committed to the privacy and security of your data. Our goal is to help you organize, find, and
      use
      your data to be your most productive self while respecting your privacy and honoring the commitments we've made in
      our Three Laws of Data Protection. Follow the links on this page to learn more.

        <h3>Data Ownership</h3> 
    <p>


      We do not own your data. Putting notes and other content into Bullet Planner does not change that content's
      ownership or
      copyright status. If the data was yours to begin with, it remains yours after you put it in Bullet Planner. Of
      course,
      if the data wasn’t yours to begin with, putting it in Bullet Planner doesn’t make it yours. This is true of all of
      our
      products and services.

      By using our products, you give Bullet Planner permission to do certain things with your data so that we can run
      our
      service. For example, you give us permission to back it up, send it over a network, index it for searching,
      display it on your various devices, etc. Some of these operations may require us to send your data to our normal
      business partners–such as a network operator–that we have contracted with to provide parts of the Bullet Planner
      Service. Before we do this, we’ll always make sure that our contracts with such partners protect your ownership
      rights.

      Other than giving us the permission to perform these limited operations so we can run the Bullet Planner Service,
      you
      retain all the rights to your data.

        <h3>Data Protection</h3>


    <p>
      Everything you put into Bullet Planner is private by default. We are not a “big data” company and do not try to
      make
      money from your content. Our systems automatically analyze your data in order to power Bullet Planner features,
      such as
      search and related notes, and to tell you about important features and products that we think will enhance your
      Bullet Planner experience, but we never give or sell your content to any third party for advertising purposes.

      Our business model is old-fashioned: we only make money when you decide to pay us for a great product. This means
      that trust is our biggest asset and keeping your data private is fundamental.

      There are features in Bullet Planner which allow you to publish and share some of your notes with others, but
      these are
      totally optional and whether or not you use them is up to you. If you choose to connect your Bullet Planner
      account with
      one of our many partners, you may be giving the partner access to some or all of your data. We will tell you how
      the partner application will access your account and you can turn off access whenever you want.

      In addition, we take many precautions to protect your data from accidental loss and theft. Everything you put into
      an Bullet Planner synchronized notebook is stored in our secure data center with multiple redundant servers,
      storage
      devices and off-site backups. Communications between Bullet Planner clients and servers (and between our various
      data
      centers) are all encrypted. We provide industry-leading security technologies, like two factor authentication, to
      all users, and we’re constantly investing in ways to improve data protection. We take the utmost care in
      protecting your password and no one at Bullet Planner will ever ask you for it.
