            <h1>WHAT IS BULLET JOURNALING</h1>

            <p>Bullet Journaling is a methodology created by  Ryder Carroll, when forced to figure out alternate ways to be focused and productive when he was diagnosed with learning disabilities early in life. The goal of this system is to help users  live intentional lives, ones that are both productive and meaningful.</p>
            <p>It's a rapid logging system where information is collected as bullet lists instead of full sentences.</p>
            <p>The true value of the Bullet Journal is mental--it's been called a mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity tool. For one thing, it can help you eliminate unnecessary tasks that are taking up your time and mental bandwidth.</p>
            <p>The true purpose of a Bullet Journal is to de-clutter your mind by writing things down.</p>
            <p>The Bullet Journal is a useful and pleasant way to clear your mind and help you focus on what's important. It gives you a more holistic view of your life and work!</p>

            <h1>WHY BULLET JOURNALING</h1>

            <p>A driving purpose of a bullet journal is to give the flurry of thoughts inside your head a landing place. Organizing thoughts is a great thing, but the first step is collecting them. This application is just the place for such collecting. When thoughts are down in one place, then you know what you're working with when it comes to prioritizing time, action and energy.</p>
            <p>Through the practice of monthly, weekly and daily reflection and setup times, this application prompts planning, remembering, dreaming, goal setting and brainstorming. It provides space for accountability and catalogs all the "small" things that add up to the bigger story of life.</p>
