              from time to time in connection with specific Service offerings (all of which we collectively refer to as the

              Service. If you do register for or otherwise use our Service you shall be deemed to confirm your acceptance of the
              Terms and your agreement to be a party to this binding contract.

              <h3>What Is the Bullet planner Service?</h3>

            services and
            websites hosted or made available by Bullet planner, including, for example our App Center, User Forum, and Help &

            the Service, you agree to abide by these Terms.

              <h3>If This Is a Contract, Who Are the Parties?</h3>
       
      
          <p>You, the Account Holder, are one party to this contract. (An Account Holder is the person or
            entity who has contracted with Bullet planner as either an individual Basic, Plus, or Premium user or as a
            Customer as
            defined in our Bullet planner Business Agreement.)
      
            If you reside in the United States or Canada, then the other party to this contract is Bullet planner Corporation,
            a
            corporation headquartered in California. If you reside in Brazil, then the other party to this contract is
            Bullet planner do Brasil Serviços de Aplicações Ltda., a company headquartered in the city of São Paulo, State of
            Sao
            Paolo, Brazil (“Bullet planner Brasil”). If you reside outside of the United States, Canada and Brazil, then the
            other
            party to this contract is Bullet planner GmbH, a company headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. (Bullet planner
            Corporation,
            Bullet planner GmbH and Bullet planner Brasil, as applicable, may be referred to in these Terms of Service as
            “Bullet planner,”
            “we”
            and sometimes “us”).
      
            On some occasions, you may be purchasing products or service subscriptions from an authorized reseller. Please
            review our Commercial Terms for information about additional contract terms relating to such purchases.

              <h3>Is This the Only Contract I Have with Bullet planner?</h3>
      
          <p>
            It depends upon how you interact with the Bullet planner service and our software applications. If you install any
            Bullet planner Software on your computing devices, you may be asked to agree to an end user license agreement. If
            you
            pay for an Bullet planner subscription, you will be asked to agree to the Commercial Terms. If you use related
            Bullet planner
            products or services (such as Bullet planner Business) or participate in our User Forum, you may also need to
            enter into
            a separate agreement with us (usually by clicking “accept” or “agree”). We refer to each of these as a “Separate
            Agreement.” If that happens, the Separate Agreement shall take precedence if there is a conflict between those
            terms and this Terms of Service document, to the extent of such conflict and with respect to the particular
            subject matter of that Separate Agreement.

              <h3>Will These Terms of Service Ever Change?</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms may be amended as new features, technology, or legal requirements arise, so please check back from
            time to time. If we make a significant change, we’ll notify you and, where required, seek your consent.
            <br>
            If we do update these Terms, you are free to decide whether to accept the updated terms or to stop using our
            Service (see “How is My Account Closed” below); your continued use of the Service after the effectiveness of that
            update will be deemed to represent your agreement with, and consent to be bound by, the new Terms. Except for
            changes made by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms shall be effective unless
            set forth in a written agreement expressly amending these Terms and bearing a written signature by you and us. For
            clarity, email or other communications will not constitute an effective written agreement for this purpose.
